# Data Models

PocketLedger now uses Prisma ORM. The canonical schema lives in `prisma/schema.prisma`, which defines the `User`, `Transaction`, `Category`, and `Invoice` models (plus nested `InvoiceItem`). This README acts as a placeholder so the expected folder structure is retained even though the model definitions live inside Prisma.
